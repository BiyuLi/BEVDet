## News
* \[2022/4/1\] We propose BEVDet4D to lift the scalable BEVDet paradigm from the spatial-only 3D space to the spatial-temporal 4D space. Technical report is released on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17054).
* \[2022/4/1\] We upgrade the BEVDet paradigm with some modifications to improve its performance and inference speed. [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11790).
* \[2021/12/23\] BEVDet is now on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11790).
